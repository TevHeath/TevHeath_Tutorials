# Internship Experience

Throughout my experience and employment as a project-orientated leader and strategist I have been able to develop professional skills focused on evidence based decision-making, transparent strategic leadership & evaluation, and valuable data-driven visualization methods within the public sector. As a business professional my technical skills and experience has allowed me to achieve best practices results through outcome-based strategies development and execution. My recent experience has allowed me to develop and hone my many skills in business analytics, statistical modelling and strategy with client engagement and deliverables, and I approach every challenge with a data-driven mindset while maintaining and building client relationships towards meaningful reports, actionable items, and solution-oriented results.
