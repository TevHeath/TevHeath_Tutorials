# Welcome

Hello world, I am a **Computer Engineering** student at the University of Guelph. My professional interests focus on the software and hardware design as it relates to application of the electromagnestic spectrum using electrical engineering techniques. I am a driven and passion student focused on to designing meaningful projects. I enjoy collaborating with classmates and building relationships with industry leaders on designing electrical & computer engineering hardware & emerging technologies such as Printed Circuit Board (PCBs) and software development design through the balance of low-level programming, software engineering principles, and efficient engineering methodologies. 


I always believe in the products that I find myself collaborating with the start of engineering idea to the final completion and manufacturing. I enjoy team-build and continuing to ensure that throughout the design process that projects and products remain practical, purposeful, and safe for clients, consumers, and customers can utilize effortless. Finally with my knowledge is continuing to grow, my passion and growing interest lies in designing projects for educational and commercial use within the field of energy systems, communications frameworks, and computer hardware networks related to renewable/alternative sources of energy. 

<!-- Prior to attending the University of Guelph, I completed my Honours Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degree from McMaster University in **Mathematics and Statistics**. During my tenure in McMaster University's Mathematics & Statistics Program, key courses and studies remained as a focus in my studies. These courses were Data Science, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Computational Statistics using R, and Mathematical Modelling using C and Python. Finally, many of my extracurricular activities were aimed in mentoring first year international science, mathematics, and business students. -->

At the University of Guelph, I strive to become a project leader and an established researcher in engineering and engineering design projects, while leveraging my professional network and internship experience.

Feel free to send me a message on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t-j-prescod-heath-bb9697284/)  I am always open to chat and connect, simply send me a note, and we can easily have a virtual coffee and discuss our common interest. I always enjoy sharing my experience and providing meaningful solutions!
