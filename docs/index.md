# Welcome

Hello world, My name is TJ and I am a **Computer Engineering** and a **Minor in Physics** student at the University of Guelph. I enrolled in University of Guelph to learn from industry leaders of engineering and utilize the engineering curriculum and teaching styles consisting of Engineering design projects each year.

My **software development mission** focuses on designing software solutions (e.g., Web & Mobile Application) geared toward empowering the parent-child relationship through assisting software application that allow both the parent and child to learn together.

My **research interests** as an undergraduate student focuses on both software application and the engineering hardware design application of the electromagnetic spectrum using electrical engineering techniques. I am a driven and passion student focused on to designing meaningful projects. 

Currently, I am involved in **two student clubs** where I focus on building technologies that assist in the clubs mission and competition requirement. For example, for the Gryphon Aerospace, I am assist in designing a Printed Circuit Board using Cadence OrCAD and Altium Designer. And for the University of Guelph's Creative Collaborative Collective, I am assisting with other software developers on designing our first dynamic website using React and Node.Js and a bookshelf database using MongoDB.


I always believe that a great engineering design requires **collaboration**, **project management**, and **teamwork**. Resulting in me consistently finding myself collaborating with the start of engineering idea to the final completion and manufacturing. I enjoy team-build and continuing to ensure that throughout the design process that projects and products remain practical, purposeful, and safe for clients, consumers, and customers can utilize effortless. Finally, with my knowledge is continuing to grow, my passion and growing interest lies in designing projects for educational and commercial use within the software application development, system design software engineering, visible light communication engineering design, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design & Project Management. 

<!-- Prior to attending the University of Guelph, I completed my Honours Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degree from McMaster University in **Mathematics and Statistics**. During my tenure in McMaster University's Mathematics & Statistics Program, key courses and studies remained as a focus in my studies. These courses were Data Science, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, and Computational Statistics using R, and Mathematical Modelling using C and Python. Finally, many of my extracurricular activities were aimed in mentoring first year international science, mathematics, and business students. -->

At the University of Guelph, I am striving to become a professional engineer (P.Eng) in Ontario and Alberta and an established Canadian engineering researcher in electrical and computer engineering, while leveraging my professional network and internship experience.

Feel free to send me a message on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/t-j-prescod-heath-bb9697284/)  I am always open to chat and connect, simply send me a note, and we can easily have a virtual coffee and discuss our common interest. I always enjoy sharing my experience and providing meaningful solutions!
